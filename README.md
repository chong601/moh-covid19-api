# moh-covid19-api

Because speedrunning code writing is fun™.

Jokes aside, this project provides [Ministry of Health Malaysia COVID-19 data](https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public) data in API form.

API specification will be defined soon™.
# Things to work on
- [in progress] Better database model (the source data makes it difficult to build one)
- [in progress] Complete the initial REST API implementation
- [in progress] Make CSV data import less cancerous (it's pretty cancerific)
- Code cleanups
- Make PR to [official Ministry of Health Malaysia COVID-19 repository](https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public) to promote this project!
